It's always a stereotype about working as a developer is that: We hate testing. This is due to its notority for being time-consuming and adding pressure to a day-to-day's workload (it's boring too?..). I see this as a mistake that many juniors often make (I did use to not like it too), but having a fully-tested application makes the deployment and maintainance much better.

Given this context, I'll try to clarify the sweet things about E2E testing and provide you a tool to work on it in JavaScript/TypeScript. Let's get testing~~~
